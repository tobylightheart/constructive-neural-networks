# constructive-neural-networks
A repository for algorithms that create neurons in artificial neural networks.

## Early development
The plan for this repository is to produce a variety of constructive neural networks (from literature and novel) using common neural networks libraries starting with PyTorch.
Initially there is going to be some experimenting with different approaches to adding neurons to networks in PyTorch done using Jupyter Notebooks.
As these experiments mature, the plan is to develop them into tutorials and to create a Python module that can be imported into other projects.
